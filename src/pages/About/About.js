    <p>
    I have always loved problem-solving and design, and I possess an incessant desire to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
    I graduated from UT Austin with a degree in Architecture. After several years, I returned
     to UT Austin to study Computer Science. While in school, I landed a great job as a game developer
      and pursued software development as a new career. When I became a mom, I chose to take a break
       from my development career to focus on family.
    </p>
    <p>
    I rejoined the workforce in the field of technical sales where I use my knowledge of development
     to assist prospective customers in finding the best technical solution for their needs. I am currently
      a member of the software team for an engineering firm in the oil and gas industry. As part of my 
      interest in forever-learning, I completed UT Austin's full stack web development bootcamp where I gained 
      experience working with current web tools and technologies for front end, back end and database development
      including HTML 5.0/CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, GitHub, Handlebars, Node.js, React, PHP, Firebase, Mongo, 
      Mongoose, CLI, (add more)
      </p>
    <p>
      With the fast-paced ever-changing technology landscape, full stack web development has rekindled my love 
      of programming and has become be both an exciting challenge and a excellent way to continually evolve.
